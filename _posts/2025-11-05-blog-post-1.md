We build temples of knowledge,

but the worshippers grow weary inside.

We speak of progress,

while the minds that power it quietly fade.

In the name of excellence,

we trade curiosity for survival.

Innovation shines on paper,

but the dreamer’s heart goes unread.

One day, I will uncover the bitter truth of the life walked by those
who dare to pursue the path of innovation and research —
a path often chosen by the middle and lower classes,
driven not by comfort, but by courage and conviction.
I may be no one to speak for them now,
but I promise myself this: I will research and write a book that tells their story —
a self-contained work, written from the heart, born out of experience, empathy, and truth.
