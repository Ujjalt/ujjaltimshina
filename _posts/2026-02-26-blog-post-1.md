This post revisits **how long complex numbers lived in the shadows** before anyone dared to understand them.  
For centuries, mathematicians stumbled upon expressions like \(\sqrt{-1}\) without realising what they had touched — dismissing them as errors, impossibilities, or meaningless symbols. From **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}** accidentally generating negative square roots, to **:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}** writing them down only to reject them, the path to acceptance was anything but straightforward.

By the time **:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}** gave them structure and **:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}** finally legitimised them, complex numbers had already endured centuries of confusion, doubt, and accidental rediscovery.

And yet, in our rush forward, we often **forget to even appreciate** how much struggle was woven into the ideas we now take for granted.
