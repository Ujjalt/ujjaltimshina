Of course. Here is a poem for you.

**Gravity**

This is the hour when the walls lean in,
A silent, heavy, dust-cloth gray.
When the clock's tick is a dying grin,
And tomorrow is a forgotten day.

This is the weight no one else can see,
A stone that sits right in your chest.
A familiar, cold anatomy,
That puts all other pains to rest.

The world outside is a painted screen,
A happy play you're not cast in.
A dull and constant, low-grade ache,
Beneath the skin, beneath the skin.

But wait—a crack. A slant of light,
Not bright or grand, but soft and slow.
A single bird takes sudden flight,
A feeling you used to know.

It does not shout, it does not mend,
The heavy stone is still its guest.
But for a moment, at the end,
It simply shares the weight of rest.

It says the night is also part
Of the slow spin of this old sphere.
That even broken things have art,
And even heavy hours are dear.
