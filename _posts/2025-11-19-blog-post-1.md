In the world of research,

everyone says the same thing —

“Criticism makes you strong.”

But they forget

that not every mind blooms

under storms.

Some of us grow best

in sunlight,

in silence,

in peace.

My PhD is not a race,

not a war,

not a place to break my spirit.

It is a long walk with a subject I love,

a quiet friendship

with ideas that choose me every day.

I entered this journey

with honesty in my heart,

not to survive harsh words,

but to understand the world more deeply.

But sometimes,

academic voices grow sharp.

They forget that their words are blades.

And a sensitive soul like mine

does not fight with knives —

it fights with thought,

with patience,

with the slow music of understanding.

I think best

when I am happy,

when my mind is clear,

when my heart is not bruised.

Yes, life has broken me before —

I have walked through jungles,

real and emotional,

searching for a place

where I could simply exist.

I have known empty nights,

fearful mornings,

and the quiet pain

of building myself again

from almost nothing.

And after all that,

I do not want more chaos

pretending to be “motivation.”

I do not want harshness

disguised as “feedback.”

I want peace —

not the fragile peace of silence,

but the strong peace

that lets a mind breathe.

I want feedback

that guides,

not wounds.

Words that build,

not break.

A voice that says,

“Here is how you can grow,”

instead of

“Here is where you failed.”

Because sensitive people

are not weak.

We feel deeply.

We think slowly but beautifully.

We rise not with pressure,

but with kindness.

And in this PhD journey,

after surviving so much already,

I only wish for one thing:

to grow strong

through understanding,

not through hurt.

To build myself

through light,

not through shadows.

To become the person

I am meant to be —

without losing

the softness

that makes me human.
