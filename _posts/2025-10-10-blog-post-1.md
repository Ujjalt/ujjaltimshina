**Thoughts on Research, Peace, and the Academic Race**- Just a casual thoughts (came up late night- PhD journey; 14th October 2025)

I have often seen how a person’s self-confidence can break after facing very harsh criticism in academics. Sometimes, one remark or one comparison is enough to shake years of quiet effort. But real research, I feel, is not built on competition or fear — it grows slowly, in calmness and patience, when someone works with honest love for the subject.

When I look around, I often see that research has become more about survival than curiosity. Everyone wants to be on the top. Everyone wants recognition, papers, and quick results. In a country where research and development already receive very little support, many researchers are managing their lives with great struggle. Some earn around ₹37,000 a month — and with that, they carry the weight of expectation, deadlines, and mental pressure. Many of them live in silent stress, sometimes even trauma. They are constantly afraid of being judged, of being seen as “less capable.”

Academia, in many ways, teaches us to survive — not to feel. We are trained to meet deadlines, to publish fast, to appear strong, even when our hearts are tired. But real learning, I believe, is not a competition. It is something that grows slowly and quietly — without the fear of missing a deadline, without the rush to prove one’s worth.

For me, survival in academics and doing research peacefully are two completely different things. The first is about external approval; the second is about inner peace. I choose the second. I may still be very young and may not fully understand the larger picture, but I know this: mathematical research gives me peace. It gives me the joy of discovering something new, not for fame or validation, but for the satisfaction of understanding it deeply.

There was a time when I used to learn a lot and think a lot. My mind was full of curiosity — everything was a question worth exploring. But sometimes these days, I feel lost in a circular loop of existence — a loop made of expectations, deadlines, and external validation. I try to remind myself that research, at its heart, is not about proving something to others but about discovering something within myself.

Deadlines, competitions, rankings — they may give existence, but not peace. They may make you visible, but not fulfilled. I do not want my research to be a race. I want it to be a journey — one that brings clarity, peace, and honesty.

Maybe it takes longer to walk this path, maybe it looks slow to others, but it feels right to me. I do not want to “survive” in academia; I want to live through it — with calmness, curiosity, and love for the subject that first made me dream.
