<p align="center">

I feel I’ve lost my way a bit,  
The world’s bright light has grown unlit.  

I miss the days I used to see  
The beauty meant for only me.  

I want to step outside this zone,  
Leave behind what feels too known.  

I don’t want to change or flee —  
I just want to be truly me.  

The skies still wait, the winds still call,  
There’s life and wonder after all.  

So I’ll walk forward, wild and free,  
To find the world —  
and find me.
