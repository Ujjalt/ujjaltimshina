<strong>Operators in the Cowen–Douglas Class</strong>, delivered as part of the 
<strong>Math Ph.D. Seminar Series</strong>, Department of Mathematics, IIIT-Delhi.
<br><br>
<strong>Talk Description:</strong><br>
The session began with the motivation behind the Cowen–Douglas class using the backward shift operator on l²(N) as the starting example. From this, the definition of the class B_n(Omega) was introduced, emphasizing its geometric characterization through the existence of an open set of eigenvalues.
<br><br>
The central theorem of Cowen and Douglas — which establishes a deep correspondence between operator theory and complex geometry — was outlined, illustrating how holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles arise naturally from operators in this class.
