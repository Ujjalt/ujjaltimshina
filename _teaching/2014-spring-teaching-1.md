I served as a Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course **MTH204: ODE/PDEs and Numerical Methods** in Spring 2025 at IIIT Delhi under **Dr. Sarthok Sircar**. My responsibilities included assisting with tutorials, grading assignments, supporting students with conceptual and computational queries, and helping them prepare for exams.
Supervised **4 Teaching Assistants** for a class of **198 students**, conducted weekly tutorial sessions, supported students in understanding theoretical and computational aspects, evaluated quizzes, assignments, and mid-semester exams, held regular office hours (~12 hours/week) for doubt clearing. This course covered ordinary and partial differential equations and their numerical solutions. Students were introduced to various analytical and computational methods used to solve real-world problems in applied mathematics and engineering.
