I served as a Lead Teaching Assistant for **MTH100: Linear Algebra** during Fall 2024 at IIIT Delhi under **Dr. Prahllad Deb**. This core undergraduate course introduced students to fundamental linear algebraic structures and their applications in science and engineering.
Led a team of **15 Teaching Assistants** for a class of **321 students**, conducted weekly tutorial sessions and held regular office hours (~12 hours/week). As a TA, my responsibilities included coordinating the TA team, overseeing and standardizing grading, grading papers and assignments, managing course spreadsheets and records, addressing advanced student queries, assisting with tutorials, and supporting the instructor with course logistics and exam preparation.
