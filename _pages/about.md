Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Ujjal Timshina, and I am currently a PhD scholar in the Department of Mathematics at the [Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT Delhi)](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/people/phd/current), working under the supervision of [Dr. Prahllad Deb](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/prahllad). I joined IIIT Delhi after being awarded the [INSPIRE Research Fellowship](https://online-inspire.gov.in/) by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India.

Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Mathematics from [Sikkim University](https://cus.ac.in/), a central university established by an Act of Parliament, Government of India. I graduated with a CGPA of 9.81 and received the University Gold Medal. My master's thesis, titled *“Nets and Filters in Topology”*, was completed under the supervision of [Dr. Namita Behera](https://cus.ac.in/index.php/en/schools-e/physical-sciences/mathematics-dept/dr-namita-behera-2). I completed my undergraduate studies at [Nar Bahadur Bhandari Government College](https://nbbgc.org/), affiliated with Sikkim University.

My research interests lie in **functional analysis and operator theory**, with a focus on the **Cowen–Douglas theory of operators** and its interplay with **complex geometry** and **differential geometry**.

I have completed doctoral-level coursework in **Functional Analysis**, **Complex Analysis**, **Several Complex Variables**, and **Introduction to Non-commutative Function Theory** and is currently studying **Matrix Groups** as a part of my coursework. Going forward, I plan to delve deeper into topics such as [**Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space), [**Spectral Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theory), [**Representation Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory). I am particularly interested in understanding how operator-theoretic ideas interface with geometric and topological frameworks.
I am also keenly interested in subjects such as [**Measure Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_theory) and [**General Topology**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_topology), which continue to shape my mathematical perspective. Beyond these, I remain curious about broader themes in modern mathematics.

For me, research is a quiet and careful journey into abstract ideas—guided not only by logic but also by curiosity, patience, and a willingness to accept uncertainty. I see mathematics as both a tool to discover truths and a way to express ideas elegantly.

We forget, make mistakes, and return —
not as failure, but as part of learning.
Understanding does not come all at once,
but grows step by step,
through patience and reflection.

I am also deeply interested in teaching, outreach, and sharing ideas. I have worked as a teaching assistant at IIIT Delhi and as a guest lecturer at Sikkim Global Technical University. I enjoy participating in mathematics Olympiad training camps, workshops, and mentoring students.

I have authored a book, Beyond Answers: Beauty of Mathematical Questions. It was my first attempt at writing and not perfect, but it reflects my interest in learning through questions. The book is available on Amazon
 and Notion Press
.
Outside of academics, I enjoy writing blogs, exploring web design and coding, and learning about open educational technologies. A selection of my talks and presentations (some with slides) is available here
. My updated CV can be accessed here [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GEbPbSA5sfkBQYyckeMoTF3b4LUb8NJ9?usp=drive_link) *(last updated: 31st August 2025)*.

I love the mountains.
It's so quiet and peaceful.
I can just breathe and be alone.
It makes me feel free.
