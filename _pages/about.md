Welcome to my homepage!

<strong>Colourless <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Green</span> Ideas Sleep Furiously — Noam Chomsky</strong>

I feel that I have become a little more mature over time, and perhaps a little more demanding of myself. My mind is often crowded with thoughts. Some days I feel extremely tired; on others, I begin with a good amount of energy that gradually fades by nightfall. Much of the time I feel uncertain, sometimes unhappy, and often a bit lost. Still, in a quiet way, I am enjoying my life — and I always honour the ancestor who first felt time for the first time, unaware that time was already watching them feel it.

My name is **Ujjal Timshina**, and I am currently a PhD scholar in the Department of Mathematics at the [Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT Delhi)](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/people/phd/current), working under the supervision of [Dr. Prahllad Deb](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/prahllad). I joined IIIT Delhi after receiving the [INSPIRE Research Fellowship](https://online-inspire.gov.in/) from the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India.

My research interests lie in **Operator Theory and Complex Analysis**, with a focus on the Cowen–Douglas theory of operators and its geometric and differential-geometric aspects.

I am open to discussions and collaborations in **Operator Theory, Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, Complex Analysis (one and several variables), Complex Geometry**, along with **General Topology and Geometry**, which I am actively learning.

### **Research Philosophy**

> **“Research must be grounded in meaning, and meaning must be examined through research. Genuine quality requires time, and time profoundly shapes mathematical understanding.”**

I am working on the classification of **homogeneous operators in the Cowen–Douglas class \(B_n(\Omega)\)** up to unitary equivalence. This problem lies at the intersection of operator theory and complex geometry and explores how symmetry and representation-theoretic structures influence operators in the Cowen–Douglas setting.

Homogeneous operators provide geometric models for Hilbert space operators, where each operator corresponds to a holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle over a complex domain.

My focus is on studying the Lie group actions that encode this homogeneity and identifying invariants that classify operators under unitary equivalence.

Currently, I am studying  
**Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), Analytic Foundations to Elliptic Curves & Modular Forms, Linear Algebraic Groups (as an introduction to Algebraic Geometry), and Algebraic Topology.**

I have completed doctoral coursework in  
**Functional Analysis, Complex Analysis, Several Complex Variables, Introduction to Non-commutative Function Theory, and Matrix Groups.**

Going forward, I plan to explore  
[**Spectral Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theory),  
[**Representation Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory), and  
[**Operator Algebras**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_algebra),  
and how operator-theoretic concepts interface with geometry and topology.

I remain deeply interested in  
[**Measure Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_theory) and  
[**General Topology**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_topology),  
which continue to refine my mathematical perspective.

Previously, I completed my **M.Sc. in Mathematics** from [Sikkim University](https://cus.ac.in/), a central university established by an Act of Parliament. I graduated with a **CGPA of 9.81** and received the **University Gold Medal**.  
My master’s thesis, *“Nets and Filters in Topology”*, was supervised by [Dr. Namita Behera](https://cus.ac.in/index.php/en/schools-e/physical-sciences/mathematics-dept/dr-namita-behera-2).  
I completed my undergraduate studies at [Nar Bahadur Bhandari Government College](https://nbbgc.org/), affiliated with Sikkim University.

### **A Personal Note**

For me, research is a quiet and careful journey into abstraction — guided by logic, curiosity, patience, and a willingness to accept uncertainty. I see mathematics not just as a discipline of truth but also as a language of elegance.

> Understanding grows slowly,  
> step by step,  
> through patience and reflection.**

I enjoy teaching, outreach, and working with students. I have been a teaching assistant at IIIT Delhi and a guest lecturer at Sikkim Global Technical University. I regularly participate in Olympiad training camps, workshops, and mentoring activities.

I have authored a book, **Beyond Answers: Beauty of Mathematical Questions**, available on *Amazon* and *Notion Press*. It was my first attempt at writing — imperfect but honest.

Outside academics, I enjoy writing blogs, designing webpages, coding small tools, and exploring open educational technology.

A selection of my talks and slides can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/ujjal-timshina/slides-selected-talks).  
My updated CV is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GEbPbSA5sfkBQYyckeMoTF3b4LUb8NJ9?usp=drive_link) *(last updated: 31st August 2025)*.

**“I enjoy reading the elegantly written articles and lecture notes at Terry Tao’s blog [here](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/) and J.S. Milne’s mathematics site [here](https://www.jmilne.org/math/).”**

There is no rigid boundary between pure and applied mathematics. What we call *pure* and *applied* are simply different lenses through which we view the same ideas. The deepest theories often emerge from practical needs, and applications evolve from abstract thought.

My mathematical philosophy is to move freely across these viewpoints — guided by structure, rigor, and an open curiosity.
