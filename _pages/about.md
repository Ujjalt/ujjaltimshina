Welcome to my homepage!

**Life roars with madness, and somehow, I’m still here—enjoying every reckless twist of it !!**

As most people end with a quote, I choose to begin with one—perhaps it’s the left-handed instinct in me to do sometimes and somethings the other way around.

<strong>Colourless <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Green</span> Ideas Sleep Furiously — Noam Chomsky</strong>



I feel that I have become a little more mature over time, and perhaps a little more demanding of myself. My mind is often crowded with thoughts. Some days I feel extremely tired; on others, I begin with a good amount of energy that gradually fades by the end of the day. Much of the time I feel uncertain, sometimes unhappy, and often a bit lost. Still, in a quiet way, I am enjoying my life and I always think and honour the ancestor who first felt time for the first time, unaware that time was already watching them feel it. 


My name is Ujjal Timshina, and I am currently a PhD scholar in the Department of Mathematics at the [Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT Delhi)](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/people/phd/current), working under the supervision of [Dr. Prahllad Deb](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/prahllad). I joined IIIT Delhi after being awarded the [INSPIRE Research Fellowship](https://online-inspire.gov.in/) by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India.

My research interests lie in **Operator Theory and Complex Analysis** with a focus on the Cowen–Douglas theory of operators and its interplay with complex geometry and differential geometry.

I am open to discussions and research collaborations in areas such as **Operator Theory, Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, Complex Analysis** (both single and several variables), **Complex Geometry**, as well as in **General Topology and Geometry**, which I am actively in the process of learning.

Research must be grounded in meaning, and meaning must be examined through research. Genuine quality requires time, and time profoundly shapes one’s mathematical understanding—this remains my foremost priority.

I am working on the classification of homogeneous operators in the Cowen–Douglas class B_n(Ω) up to unitary equivalence. This problem lies at the intersection of operator theory and complex geometry and seeks to understand how symmetry and representation-theoretic properties influence the structure of operators within the Cowen–Douglas framework.

The study of homogeneous operators is central to understanding geometric models of Hilbert space operators, where each operator can be associated with a holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle over a complex domain.

My current research focuses on describing these operators using the actions of Lie groups and identifying invariants that determine their equivalence classes under unitary transformations.

I am studying **Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), Analytic Foundations to Elliptic Curves and Modular Forms and Linear Algebraic Groups (for an introduction to Algebraic Geometry)** in the current semester. I have completed doctoral-level coursework in **Functional Analysis**, **Complex Analysis**, **Several Complex Variables**, **Introduction to Non-commutative Function Theory** and **Matrix Groups** as a part of my coursework. Going forward, I plan to delve deeper into topics such as [**Spectral Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theory), [**Representation Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory). I am particularly interested in understanding how operator-theoretic ideas interface with geometric and topological frameworks.
I am also keenly interested in subjects such as [**Measure Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_theory) and [**General Topology**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_topology), which continue to shape my mathematical perspective. Beyond these, I remain curious about broader themes in modern mathematics.

Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Mathematics from [Sikkim University](https://cus.ac.in/), a central university established by an Act of Parliament, Government of India. I graduated with a CGPA of 9.81 and received the University Gold Medal. My master's thesis, titled *“Nets and Filters in Topology”*, was completed under the supervision of [Dr. Namita Behera](https://cus.ac.in/index.php/en/schools-e/physical-sciences/mathematics-dept/dr-namita-behera-2). I completed my undergraduate studies at [Nar Bahadur Bhandari Government College](https://nbbgc.org/), affiliated with Sikkim University.


For me, research is a quiet and careful journey into abstract ideas—guided not only by logic but also by curiosity, patience, and a willingness to accept uncertainty. I see mathematics as both a tool to discover truths and a way to express ideas elegantly.

We forget, make mistakes, and return —
not as failure, but as part of learning.
Understanding does not come all at once,
but grows step by step,
through patience and reflection.

I am also deeply interested in teaching, outreach, and sharing ideas. I have worked as a teaching assistant at IIIT Delhi and as a guest lecturer at Sikkim Global Technical University. I enjoy participating in mathematics Olympiad training camps, workshops, and mentoring students.

I have authored a book, Beyond Answers: Beauty of Mathematical Questions. It was my first attempt at writing and not perfect, but it reflects my interest in learning through questions. The book is available on Amazon
 and Notion Press
.
Outside of academics, I enjoy writing blogs, exploring web design and coding, and learning about open educational technologies. A selection of my talks and presentations (some with slides) is available here [here](https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/ujjal-timshina/slides-selected-talks)
. My updated CV can be accessed here [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GEbPbSA5sfkBQYyckeMoTF3b4LUb8NJ9?usp=drive_link) *(last updated: 31st August 2025)*.

**Mountains. Solitude. Breath. Peace.**

**When rigor takes a coffee break.**

**“I enjoy reading the elegantly written articles and lecture notes available at Terry Tao blogs [here](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/) and Mathematics Site - J.S. Milne [here](https://www.jmilne.org/math/).”**

There is no real gap between pure and applied mathematics. What we call “pure” and “applied” are only different ways of looking at the same ideas. Every branch of mathematics is deeply connected, and concepts developed for abstraction often become the language of applications, while applied problems constantly generate new pure theory. My mathematical philosophy is to move freely across these boundaries, guided by structure, rigor, and curiosity rather than labels.

**The main goal of this website is simple: to collect the moments I have spent with mathematics so far in my life.**

**This space is for my thoughts, struggles, and small understandings — just memories of breathing mathematics.**
