Welcome to my homepage!

**Not preparing to live someday — but living, here and now. Breathing joy into each moment as it unfolds**.

**To think is to riot; to question is to live; to answer is to decay.**



My name is Ujjal Timshina, and I am currently a PhD scholar in the Department of Mathematics at the [Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT Delhi)](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/people/phd/current), working under the supervision of [Dr. Prahllad Deb](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/prahllad). I joined IIIT Delhi after being awarded the [INSPIRE Research Fellowship](https://online-inspire.gov.in/) by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India.

I am open to any discussions related to mathematics and research collaborations in areas such as Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, Operator Theory, Complex Analysis (Single and Several Variables), Complex Geometry or even in the fields of General Topology and Geometry.

My research interests lie in functional analysis and operator theory, with a focus on the Cowen–Douglas theory of operators and its interplay with complex geometry and differential geometry.

I am working on the classification of homogeneous operators in the Cowen–Douglas class B_n(Ω) up to unitary equivalence. This problem lies at the intersection of operator theory and complex geometry and seeks to understand how symmetry and representation-theoretic properties influence the structure of operators within the Cowen–Douglas framework.

The study of homogeneous operators is central to understanding geometric models of Hilbert space operators, where each operator can be associated with a holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle over a complex domain.

My current research focuses on describing these operators using the actions of Lie groups and identifying invariants that determine their equivalence classes under unitary transformations.

I have completed doctoral-level coursework in **Functional Analysis**, **Complex Analysis**, **Several Complex Variables**, and **Introduction to Non-commutative Function Theory** and is currently studying **Matrix Groups** as a part of my coursework. Going forward, I plan to delve deeper into topics such as [**Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space), [**Spectral Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theory), [**Representation Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory). I am particularly interested in understanding how operator-theoretic ideas interface with geometric and topological frameworks.
I am also keenly interested in subjects such as [**Measure Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_theory) and [**General Topology**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_topology), which continue to shape my mathematical perspective. Beyond these, I remain curious about broader themes in modern mathematics.

Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Mathematics from [Sikkim University](https://cus.ac.in/), a central university established by an Act of Parliament, Government of India. I graduated with a CGPA of 9.81 and received the University Gold Medal. My master's thesis, titled *“Nets and Filters in Topology”*, was completed under the supervision of [Dr. Namita Behera](https://cus.ac.in/index.php/en/schools-e/physical-sciences/mathematics-dept/dr-namita-behera-2). I completed my undergraduate studies at [Nar Bahadur Bhandari Government College](https://nbbgc.org/), affiliated with Sikkim University.


For me, research is a quiet and careful journey into abstract ideas—guided not only by logic but also by curiosity, patience, and a willingness to accept uncertainty. I see mathematics as both a tool to discover truths and a way to express ideas elegantly.

We forget, make mistakes, and return —
not as failure, but as part of learning.
Understanding does not come all at once,
but grows step by step,
through patience and reflection.

I am also deeply interested in teaching, outreach, and sharing ideas. I have worked as a teaching assistant at IIIT Delhi and as a guest lecturer at Sikkim Global Technical University. I enjoy participating in mathematics Olympiad training camps, workshops, and mentoring students.

I have authored a book, Beyond Answers: Beauty of Mathematical Questions. It was my first attempt at writing and not perfect, but it reflects my interest in learning through questions. The book is available on Amazon
 and Notion Press
.
Outside of academics, I enjoy writing blogs, exploring web design and coding, and learning about open educational technologies. A selection of my talks and presentations (some with slides) is available here [here](https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/ujjal-timshina/slides-selected-talks)
. My updated CV can be accessed here [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GEbPbSA5sfkBQYyckeMoTF3b4LUb8NJ9?usp=drive_link) *(last updated: 31st August 2025)*.
