    I presented a **departmental poster** at an academic event organized by the  
    <strong>Department of Science and Technology, Government of Sikkim</strong> in <strong>2022</strong>,  
    representing the <strong>Department of Mathematics, Sikkim University</strong>.
    <br><br>
    The poster highlighted key academic strengths of the department, student-driven initiatives, and foundational research areas including  
    <em>topology, analysis, and algebra</em>.  
    The presentation served to promote mathematical research, outreach, and university-level academic engagement.
