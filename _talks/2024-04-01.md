  <strong> Transformation Geometry: The Complete Symmetries of Regular Shapes</strong>, delivered at <strong>INMO Training Camp, SMIT Sikkim</strong>, Majitar, Sikkim, India, funded by HBCSE, TIFR, 2024.
  
  <br><br>
  <strong>Overview:</strong> The lecture introduced participants to the ideas of <strong>geometrical transformations</strong> and <strong>symmetry groups</strong>, focusing on their role in understanding the structure and classification of regular shapes.
  
  <br><br>
  This session was designed for Olympiad-level students preparing for national mathematical contests and aimed at bridging abstract algebra with geometric intuition.
