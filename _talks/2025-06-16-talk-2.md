  <strong>‼️ Geometry of Möbius Transformation and Inversion</strong>, delivered during the <strong>Undergraduate Summer Program in Mathematics</strong>, Department of Mathematics, IIIT-Delhi, from <strong>June 16–28, 2025</strong>.
  
  <br><br>
  <strong>Description:</strong> The lecture series explored the geometric depth of <strong>Möbius transformations</strong>, including their classification, fixed points, and behavior on the extended complex plane. Special emphasis was placed on <strong>inversion geometry</strong> and its strong ties to <strong>conformal mappings</strong>.
  
  <br><br>
  <strong>Topics Included:</strong>
  <ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
    <li>Möbius transformations as compositions of simpler maps</li>
    <li>Fixed points and classification: elliptic, hyperbolic, loxodromic, parabolic</li>
    <li>Geometry of inversion on the extended complex plane</li>
    <li>Circles, lines, and their invariance under Möbius maps</li>
    <li>Applications in complex analysis and conformal geometry</li>
  </ul>
