  <strong> An Introduction to Non-Commutative Functions and Their Difference-Differential Calculus</strong>, delivered at <strong>Department of Mathematics, Sikkim University</strong>, Gangtok, Sikkim, India, 22nd May 2025.
  
  <br><br>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> This talk introduced the foundational ideas in <strong>non-commutative function theory</strong>, highlighting how classical calculus concepts extend to the non-commutative setting. The focus was on the role of difference-differential operators in analyzing free (non-commutative) functions and their applications in operator theory.
