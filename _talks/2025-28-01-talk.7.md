Delivered a talk on the **Operators in the Cowen--Douglas Class** on the **Math PhD semiar series**, organized by the **Department of Mathematics, IIIT-Delhi**.

Talk Description

The talk began with the motivation behind the Cowen–Douglas class of operators, using the backward shift operator on ℓ²(ℕ) as the starting point. From this example, the definition of the Cowen–Douglas class B_n(Ω) was introduced, highlighting its characterization through the existence of an open set of eigenvalues. The central theorem of Cowen and Douglas, which forges a deep link between operator theory and complex geometry, was briefly outlined.
