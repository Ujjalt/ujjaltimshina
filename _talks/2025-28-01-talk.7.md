  <strong>Operators in the Cowen–Douglas Class</strong>, delivered as part of the <strong>Math Ph.D. Seminar Series</strong>, Department of Mathematics, IIIT-Delhi.

  <strong>Talk Description:</strong><br>
  The session began with the motivation behind the Cowen–Douglas class using the backward shift operator on ℓ²(ℕ) as the starting point. From this example, the definition of the class B<sub>n</sub>(Ω) was introduced, emphasizing its geometric characterization through the presence of an open set of eigenvalues.

  The central theorem of Cowen and Douglas—which establishes a deep correspondence between operator theory and complex geometry—was outlined, illustrating how holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles naturally arise from operators in this class.
