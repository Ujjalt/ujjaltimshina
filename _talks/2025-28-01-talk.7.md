  <strong> Operators in the Cowen–Douglas Class</strong>, delivered as part of the <strong>Math Ph.D. Seminar Series</strong>, Department of Mathematics, IIIT-Delhi.

  <strong>Talk Description:</strong><br>
  The session began with the motivation behind the <strong>Cowen–Douglas class</strong> using the backward shift operator on ℓ²(ℕ) as the foundational example. Building from this, the definition of the class \( B_n(\Omega) \) was introduced, emphasizing its geometric characterization through the existence of an open set of eigenvalues.

  <br><br>

  The central theorem of <strong>Cowen and Douglas</strong>—which establishes a deep correspondence between operator theory and complex geometry—was presented in outline, highlighting how holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles naturally arise from operators in this class.
