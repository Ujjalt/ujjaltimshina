## M.Sc Thesis

<div style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
  My master's thesis, titled <strong><em>“Nets and Filters in Topology”</em></strong>, explores foundational concepts in general topology that serve as alternatives to sequences, particularly in non-metrizable spaces. It investigates the convergence behavior of nets and filters, their interplay, and their importance in compactness, continuity, and related topological properties.
